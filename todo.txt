*** Unimplemented features/things to think about doing ***

Remove Portals, replace with Mutators. Requirements:
 * Pass player input when a guy collides with portal.
 * Make mutator return ObjectAndTime.
 * Note: No need to pass object and time as mutators happen before any other time travel.
 * Remember to maintain the distinction between interactable boxes/guys and ones that 'left'.
 * * Left if any of timeDirection, nextTime or arrival basis is not equal to the premutaed value
 
Add lua-only data to Guys and Boxes.
 * Think about type; Vector? Map? Map of vectors?
 
Think about removing illegal portal? With the above 2 things implemented it is possible.

Replace most frontend drawing with Glitz:
 * Glitz created in C++ physics
 * Passed to guy and box steps. Glitz added in there.
 * Merged with trigger system Glitz?
 * Current Guy is still used for drawing (time direction, inventory...)
 
Give lua ability to return foreground and background Glitz (before or after physics)
 
Add persistent Glitz?
 * A new data type that creates appropriate Glitz
 * Propagates through physics for an appropriate amount of time
 * For persistent effects such as lasers or explosions
 * Allow trigger system to create it? (this is for lazy "now I want explosion gfx")
 
Time Guns
 * Physics: Finish raytrace algo
 * Requires persistent Glitz and line Glitz to visualise.
 
Think about pause time
 * A Guy that departs to it's current frame
 * This seems to replicate the old pause time specs.
 * Guy could shoot other guys, even into pause time.
 * Works as long as nothing can interact with guy.
 * Does not work for boxes as they'd chronofrag themselves, would work if they could go ethereal for pause.
 * These pause times would be limited to a single agent. No 'alternate time stream' with 2 entities.
 * Aka reverse or forwards time in pause time means nothing.
 
Let currentPlayerFrame not have a player departure.
 * Add currentPlayerDirection
 * Remove current workarounds
 * * Mutator death and win portal should set currentPlayer stuff
