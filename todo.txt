*** Unimplemented features/things to think about doing ***

----===== DETAILED CODING ISSUES =====-----

Remove Portals, replace with Mutators. Requirements:
 * Pass player input when a guy collides with portal.
 * Make mutator return ObjectAndTime.
 * Note: No need to pass object and time as mutators happen before any other time travel.
 * Remember to maintain the distinction between interactable boxes/guys and ones that 'left'.
   * Left if any of timeDirection, nextTime or arrival basis is not equal to the premutated value

Add lua-only data to Guys and Boxes.
 * Think about type; Vector? Map? Map of vectors?
 
Think about removing illegal portal? With the above 2 things implemented it is possible.

Give lua ability to return foreground and background Glitz (before or after physics)

Add persistent Glitz?
 * A new data type that creates appropriate Glitz
 * Propagates through physics for an appropriate amount of time
 * For persistent effects such as lasers or explosions
 * Allow trigger system to create it? (this is for lazy "now I want explosion gfx")
 
Time Guns
 * Physics: Finish raytrace algo
 * Requires persistent Glitz and line Glitz to visualise.
 
Think about pause time
 * A Guy that departs to it's current frame
 * This seems to replicate the old pause time specs.
 * Guy could shoot other guys, even into pause time.
 * Works as long as nothing can interact with guy.
 * Does not work for boxes as they'd chronofrag themselves, would work if they could go ethereal for pause.
 * These pause times would be limited to a single agent. No 'alternate time stream' with 2 entities.
 * Aka reverse or forwards time in pause time means nothing.
 
Let currentPlayerFrame not have a player departure.
 * Add currentPlayerDirection
 * Remove current workarounds
   * Mutator death and win portal should not stop currentPlayer setting

Improve Input
 * Send frame of relevant input with mutateObject on Guys
 * Pass input in more raw form. Mouse position etc...
 * Enum for key holding, 4 states:
   * OFF (not held at all)
   * PRESS (was off last time, now on)
   * ON (is held down)
   * RELEASE (was on last frame, now off)
 * Remove hardcoded portal/mutator actioned.

Finish and Submit Boost patch(es).

Allow boxes to be dropped somewhere other than at the feet of the guy.

Fix Div-by-zero in BoxCollisionAlgorithm

Fix Crashes and Infinite loops that can be caused by loading ill-formed levels or running out of memory while loading levels.

----===== STORYLINE ISSUES =====-----

Decide on setting
*What would happen to Victorian England with the advent of time travel?
  -Who else has the technology?
*How widespread is the time travel technology?
*Time travel is confined to short "bubbles" which can only be merged with the rest of the universe when they are free of paradoxes (no waves)
  *What are reverse time objects?
  *Why are bubbles so short (do they require lots of energy?)
  *What if several bubbles are merged at once and there is a conflict?
  *What about "bubble-chaining" to get long (temporal) distance time travel.
*Time-travel implies the ability to teleport.
  *What are some good uses for teleportation?
  *Is the teleportation distance limited? (To avoid travel to the moon/wherever)
  *How controllable is the teleportation? (You could imagine that the rotation of the earth and so on would make aiming it be quite challenging.)

-(suggestion)Time travel is known about by the majority of the population but is too impractical for the common people. ("Theoretically possible") Main character works on this.

Decide on main characters
*Main Character - the genius inventor Timothy Algenon-Porter
*His benefactor (??)
*Fellow inventors (colleagues)
*Possible Ada Lovelace cameo

Decide on main plot points
*Timothy finds himself in a pickle, tries to warn himself using time travel to prevent his death. (Possible) Results in a hideous head-grafting.

*Have non-linear storyline.
  -Write many more story lines than the length of the game, and then present the  player with many tough (or not-so-tough) decisions to make (branch at the decision points).
*Stray paradoxes === nuclear fallout
  -How do paradoxes occur? (Given that the bubbles don't allow paradoxes). (Maybe paradoxes are caused bubble conflicts (failure to merge bubbles))
  -Characters do not notice paradoxes. (Or rather, they do not notice them as state-flipping of the universe. The only thing that they will notice is the existence of things in the past that are created without a cause (??).)


*A character gets displaced by a paradox and replaced by an alternate timeline version of themselves


Write script

Design levels

----===== FRONT END =====----

*Save games? (quick save, automatic saving)
*What were those other menu options, whoops totally slipped my mind
*Something about it being a horrible hack currently

----===== GRAPHICAL =====----

**Apart from basics such as character animations, this is heavily dependent on the storyline, particularly the setting. So this is really a placeholder section.
