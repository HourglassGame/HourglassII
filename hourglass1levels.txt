### 1. Easy start ###
Summary: Introduces using past self to hold down button while future self goes through door.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 2. Open and closed ###
Summary: Similar to (1), introduces timing.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 3. Standard box puzzle ###
Summary: Introduces boxes.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 4. Not so standard... ###
Summary: Introduces taking boxes through portals.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 5. Going up ###
Summary: Many switch and timing elements. Only new thing is platform.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 6. Stacked high ###
Summary: Introduced infinite boxes.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 7. Timebelt ###
Summary: Introduced timeJump pickup and ability to move around obstructions.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 8. All the way up ###
Summary: Excersise in leaving guys on sitches to control platforms.

Status: Not immediately worth remaking. No new features.


### 9. One-way trip ###
Summary: Similar to (4). Introduces laser switch.

Status: Requires laser switch. Effectively a copy of (4).


### 10. Triplicate ###
Summary: Similar to (4) but with timeJump instead of portal.

Status: Faithfully remade (with allowances for changed jump-height)


### 11. Time and Space ###
Summary: Introduces portal attached to platform.

Status: A level such as this is worthwhile. More platform antics are possible.


### 12. Fairly routine ###
Summary: TimeJump is used to go around player created obstacle.

Status: Simple enough to remake idea.


### 13. Fish in a barrel ###
Summary: Introduces timeGun to get a box past an obstruction.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 14. Wrong way ###
Summary: Player uses timeJump to go backwards up a down platform.

Status: Level requires Game Pause and is harder to implement due to low jump height. Good UI tools would prevent chance of chronofrag in this level.


### 15. Reverse ###
Summary: Same as (14) yet implemented with timeReverse. Introduces timeReverse.

Status: Can be made.


### 16. Don't touch that ###
Summary: Box duplication to pass spikes. Has timeJump.

Status: Jump physics has changed so faithful implementation is problematic.


### 17. It's a trap ###
Summary: Level with timeJump and timeReverse at the same time.

Status: Needs laser switch to remake. Worth doing.


### 18. Alcatraz ###
Summary: TimeJump into a moving box to win.

Status: Requires Game Pause to reduce frustration. Jump physics changed but this can still be remade.


### 19. Impossible? ###
Summary: First programming level.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 20. What goes down... ###
Summary: First reverse box riding level. Box duplication via timeReverse.

Status: Faithfully remade.


### 21. Which way? ###
Summary: A fun 'trick' that Jeffrey is proud of. Can also be done with programming.

Status: Faithfully remade (with allowances for changed jump-height)


### 22. Another box puzzle ###

Summary: 

Status: As only Jeffrey even knows how to finish this, we can't recreate it at this stage.


### 28. Locked in ###
Summary: Programming past guy to get pickup such that present guy can escape.

Status: Reduced jump height poses a problem for jumping up to the top level with one box. This has been remade with two boxes.

### 29. Torqueless ###
Summary: Get over a pit of spikes by stacking boxes laterally. Works because HG physics does not model torque.

### 31. Ups and Downs ###
Summary: 

Status:


### 32. Spiky Death ###
Summary: Act fast, or die
